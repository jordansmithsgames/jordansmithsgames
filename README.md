- [Instant Messager](https://github.com/jordansmithsgames/InstantMessenger) is a peer-to-peer instant messenger (IM) program I developed for my Computer Information and Security class at the University of Florida. There are three interations of the IM: unencrypted, encrypted, and encrypted via the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. They are separated into their own branches to give you an idea of how the program developed and became more secure over time.
